--Please remember that the previous step’s <PATH> placeholder needs to be updated with the path to the L_AIRPORT_ID.csv file you just uploaded. Also, remember to use forwards slashes instead of backslashes when creating the route. It follows then that if you’re operating on a PC running Windows, and the file is located in the C:\Users\smith\ L_AIRPORT_ID.csv, then you’ll need to specify the C:/Users/smith/ L_AIRPORT_ID.csv in the PUT statement.
